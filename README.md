# CMYK-Encoder
An encoding schema using CMYK and RGBK based colour coding for the efficient storage of short and medium length data.

## Features

- Can encode binary or hex but uses half as many units.
- Can be printed onto paper and read back using provided encoder/decoder program (built on OpenCV).
- 2700 character capacity per A7 Card (perhaps even slightly more possible at this size; 3000?).

## Directory

- Viewfinder is a debugging tool for viewing generated textures.
- CMYKread is the android app for efficient encoding and decoding (TO DO).
